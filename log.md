**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Leetcode : [**496. Next Greater Element I**](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
- Leetcode : [**503. Next Greater Element II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)
- Leetcode : [**739. Daily Temperatures**](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)
- Login Component CREATED
- Designed and Planned Zipppin

**Thoughts:**
- 496 and 503 were easy questions after understanding the concept through Aditya Verma's video, But 739 was a variation of these questions, which took some time a little change in the approach and finally acheived it.
- Login component completed with States and Password visiblity icon and all the necessary CSS properties and styles.
- Planned and Shortlisted UI/UX Designs for Zipppin-URL Shortener, designs that i found are not exactly what i am gonna build but inspire from them and pickup best elements and from every design and mix them up to create a unique looking user-friendly UI.
